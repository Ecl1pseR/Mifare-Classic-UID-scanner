# Mifare Classic UID Scanner

This Python script allows scanning and recording unique identifiers (UIDs) from NFC cards using NFC readers. It continuously scans NFC cards and writes their UIDs to a file, ensuring that each UID is recorded only once to avoid duplicates.

## Features

- **NFC Card Scanning**: Automatically detects and scans NFC cards when they are placed near the NFC reader.
- **Recording Unique Identifiers**: Records the UID of each scanned card to a file, ensuring that each UID is recorded only once to avoid duplicates.
- **Interactive Console Output**: Provides interactive console output, informing the user about the scanning process and any detected errors.
- **Persistent UID Storage**: Stores recorded UIDs in a file with a unique name based on the current date.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Library `smartcard` (installed via `pip install pyscard`)

## Usage

1. Connect your NFC reader to the computer.
2. Run the Python script `UID_scanner.py`.
3. Place an NFC card on the reader.
4. The script will automatically detect and record the UID of the scanned card.
5. Each UID will be recorded in a separate file with the name `scanned_uid_<date>.txt` in the same folder as the script.

## Note

- This script requires a compatible NFC reader and corresponding drivers installed on your system.
- Ensure that your system has the necessary permissions to access the NFC reader device.
